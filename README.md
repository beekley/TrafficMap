Briefly, the goal of this project is to create a heatmap of commute times to/from different parts of LA using the Google Maps API. 

When I started working in Long Beach last year, I was considering moving to ease the commute– while at the same time, balancing Emma’s commute to UCLA. I’m putting this together to validate our decision to stay in West LA (actually, mainly for fun) by creating a heatmap of summed travel times to UCLA and Long beach from different locations in LA. I’d like to expand it to fix UCLA as one destination, home as the origin, and all of LA as the second destination to determine the geographic areas I could work in with a reasonable commute.
